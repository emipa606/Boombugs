Update of Poshspiders mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1399697593

- The boom-insects now inherits the base insects instead of copying them
- Added a boom-hive that spawns boom-insects, chemfuel and fuel-puddles
- Added a boom version of the Infestation-incident, much harder but rarer
- Only the Boomspider now have a big explosion on death, the rest uses the smaller version
- All boom-insects and their hive are now almost immune to fire
- Tame boom-insects can be milked for chemfuel
- Works well with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2359846788]BoomMod Expanded[/url]
